# Starting With React — [React JS](https://facebook.github.io/react/)

The code in this repo is a testing field for React JS. I have been learning it for the last 2 weeks and I 
wanted to build a brew day sheet, replicating the one on this website [Brewer's friend](http://www.brewersfriend.com/brewday-allgrain/)


## To Start

1. cd into `brew-day-sheet`
2. npm start.
